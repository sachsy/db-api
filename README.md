# db-api

My PostgreSQL database.  © 2015 50pop LLC | Contact: [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/)

One central database, called d50b, with each of my different projects in its own schema.

For some explanation, see <http://sivers.org/pg>

## The schemas:

* **core** : tables and functions shared by other schemas: currencies and translations
* **peeps** : people, emails, api keys. people table shared by all other schemas
* **sivers** : sivers.org blog comments
* **lat** : lateral thinking concepts
* **muckwork** : muckwork.com
* **musicthoughts** : musicthoughts.com
* **woodegg** : book research data, shared at data.woodegg.com

## In each schema directory:

* **api.sql** : main public functions, each returning mime & JSON
* **fixtures.sh** : shell script to output fixtures.sql
* **fixtures.sql** : dump of values for testing, to be loaded with each test
* **functions.sql** : any other functions, not API
* **README.md** : read me
* **schema.m4** : with each change to any .sql files, run **m4 schema.m4 > schema.sql**
* **schema.sql** : don't edit! auto generated by schema.m4
* **tables.sql** : create table
* **test-api.rb** : tests for api.sql functions
* **test-db.rb** : tests for non-API functions, like constraints, triggers, and functions
* **triggers.sql** : triggers
* **views.sql** : views used for complex JSON responses

## What's this other stuff?

* **b50d** Ruby gem with shared scripts, libraries, and configs
* **defs.m4** m4 macros used by schema.m4 in each schema directory
* **test_tools.rb** testing tools used by each schema directory


## Changes?

For small changes, just use psql to add a function, drop a table, etc.

The easiest way to make major changes is to copy the schema.sql files to /tmp/, then edit it to remove the "DROP SCHEMA" and "CREATE TABLE" lines.  All functions, triggers, and views can be replaced.

When adding a new schema, run this:

ALTER USER d50b SET SEARCH_PATH TO core, peeps, muckwork, lat, musicthoughts, sivers, woodegg;

# TODO:

* email parsing: set personID using email address first before in-reply-to
* Where to translate ugly errors (probably using regexp matching) into simple i18n keys for the UI to show in user's language?
* combine Gengo features into one CLI script

## API:

## Muckwork Client API:

* TODO: create payment, add note(projectId, taskId)

## Muckwork Worker API:

* initialize with API keys: MuckworkWorker
* get project(id)
* get task(id)
* claim task(id)
* unclaim task(id)
* start task(id)
* finish task(id)
* unclaimed tasks
* TODO: get payments, add note(projectId, taskId)
* TODO?: business rule against # of claimed tasks by worker?

## Muckwork Manager API:

* everything but init with API keys
